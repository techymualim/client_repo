              The concept behind Innox originated in 2021 during David’s brainstorming sessions for potential business ventures. From a young age, David desired to be an entrepreneur with the goal of living life on his own terms and exert full control over his endeavors. After many ventures during the years, one of them including a digital marketing agency which he closed on April 2023 & an educatinal platform that offered courses to poeple in LaTam with limited resources, Zinbed, David decided to embark on a complex yet captivating idea that would disrupt the entertainment and creator economy industry. 

              </p>
              <p className="mb-6" style={{ marginBottom: '1.4em' }}>
              Having been an long-term consumer of YouTube videos since the age of 12, David spent his middle and high school years immersed in binge-watching various content creators. He observed the journeys of numerous creators, witnessing both their rise to fame and their setbacks. Over the course of this journey, one recurring thought emerged: the potential of investing in a content creator during their early days, when their subscriber count was under 50k. Imagine the prospect of witnessing their meteoric rise to a channel with millions of devoted followers. Such an investment would not have solely rewarded the supporters who believed in the creators journey, but also introduced an additional avenue of income for the content creator, all made possible through the ingenious utilization of tokens.

              </p>
              <p className="mb-6" style={{ marginBottom: '1.4em' }}>
              Captivated by the immense potential and mutual benefits for creators and fans, David began meticulously planning and devising strategies to make this concept accessible and applicable to creators and users of diverse backgrounds and demographics. In July 2023, the website  was launched, marking the birth of the first sights of the revolutionary platform scheduled to be live by the end of August/September.

                Today, we take great pride in being the pioneers of this innovative and disruptive platform. Our primary objective is to revolutionize the entertainment landscape and provide unwavering support to creators throughout their journey.
